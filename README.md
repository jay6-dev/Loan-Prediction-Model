# Loan-Prediction-Model
This project is a simple linear regression model that predicts the probability of a customer taking a loan based on their monthly salary.
The dataset is synthetic and is designed to reflect typical metrics found in South African banking scenarios.

# Project Overview
Financial institutions often need to assess the likelihood of customers taking loans based on various factors.
This model demonstrates how a relationship between customer salary and the chance of taking a loan can be analyzed and used for predictions.

#Features
Predictive Model: A linear regression model trained to predict loan probability based on customer salary.
Synthetic Data Generation: Simulates real-world scenarios for illustrative purposes.
Visualization: Scatter plot and regression line to visualize the relationship between salary and loan chance.

#Data Description
The dataset is generated using Python and includes:

Salary (R): Monthly income of the customer in South African Rands (R).
Loan Chance (%): The probability (0-100%) that the customer would take a loan.
